# D3-challenge

The app.js script loads U.S. Census Beaureau Data from 2014 and creates an interactive chart using D3 and a svg.  The chart axes are selectable and when clicked will rescale the plot and update the data plotted on the chart.  When mousing over the data points, a tooltip appears that returns the data (x & y coordinates).  The svg plot will scale relative to the screensize.
